# Tram-Trackr

Tram Trackr is an Alexa skill which will tell you when the next bus/train/tram is arriving at your selected stop.

Many similar skills on the Amazon store only work with one public transport system. 

This skill (should) work with most public transport systems that have released their data as a GTFS.

Please keep in mind that every public transit system's data is slightly different (despite GTFS being standard). This code has currently been optimised for BC Transit in Whistler, BC, Canada. When using this skill with other public transit systems, some funny buggers may occur.

If your local public transit system is not supported, please contact the people at https://www.navitia.io/ to add it.
